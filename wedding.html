  <p class="style5"><span class="style4"><span class="style3"><img src="wedding_clip_image010.jpg" alt="hey" width="183" height="102" hspace="12" align="left" /></span><span class="style9">The big  day is fast approaching (08/08/08),  and we are excited to have you all join us on this special day. As you know by  now, both the wedding ceremony and the reception/dinner will be held at the  rural home of Colin’s parents, David and Janet Parrish, located on the  outskirts of Paris,   Ontario.  The Parrishes are in the midst of renovating a 1960’s former public school  building, so for those who have not visited before, don’t bother looking for a  traditional – style residence. Rather, it’s a grey, one-storey, flat-roofed  building. Look for the white wedding tents on the east side of the property and  you’ll know you’ve arrived. If you didn’t receive a map or if the directions  aren’t clear, please feel free to email the Parrishes at <a href="mailto:parrishjanet@hotmail.com">parrishjanet@hotmail.com</a> for further  clarification.<br />
    <br />
    If you  feel you’d like to stay overnight, there are a limited number of hotels in the  general area. For guests travelling from Hamilton, there is  the Best Western Brant Park Inn (519-753-8652) and The Days Inn (519-759-2700)  both located at Highway 403 and the Wayne Gretzky Parkway,  in Brantford. For Highway 401 travellers, there is the Best  Western (519-623-4600), Future Inns (519-622-1505) and the Holiday Inn  (519-658-4601), all in the vicinity of Highway 401 and Highway 24 / Hespeler Road, Cambridge. Finally,  in downtown Paris  there is the Arlington Hotel, a stately, 24 room facility that may be reached  at 519-442-1019. Please note: calls to each of these hotels indicate a very  limited number of rooms currently available for August 8/08. <br />
  </span></span></p>
  <p class="style5">The  wedding theme is “<u>Breakfast at Tiffany’s”,</u> a tribute to both the 1960’s  and Audrey Hepburn’s elegant style and carefree attitude!  You’ll be seated for dinner at a famous New York City landmark  table, complete with Tiffany blue adornments. We hope you’ll let us snap your photo  wearing our Breakfast at Tiffany’s props for a fun memory of the day.<br />
    <br />
    The  ceremony (to begin promptly at 5   p.m.), will be held outdoors, under the Tiffany blue sky,  weather permitting. In the event of inclement weather, we will move the service  into the tent. A buffet dinner, to be served at 7:30 p.m., will  also be held in our wedding tent on the  property. Please dress appropriately for the weather as well as the  outdoor setting. Hopefully you’ll need  sunglasses and not an umbrella!</p>
  <p class="style5">The dinner  menu will have a variety of choices. If you have any dietary constraints or  allergies, please let us know and we will ask our caterer to do his best to  accommodate these.</p>
  <p class="style5"><span class="style5">In September, Colin  and Adrienne will both be attending Ryerson University in Toronto (Colin in <u>Mechanical Engineering</u> and  Adrienne in <u>Arts and Contemporary Studies</u>). Since both have previously  lived away from home while attending university, they have already acquired  much of the household equipment needed for their new life together. However,  they have assembled a wish list of things that would be useful to them. Rather  than registering at individual stores, their complete list of items is provided  herein, accompanied by various locations at which they may be purchased.</span></p>
  <p class="style5">We hope to see you on Friday the eighth of August, for a time of celebration, fun and feasting!<br />
